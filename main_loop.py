MODES:
These are defined in the Java code `LightsStateMessage` here:
https://github.com/Team488/XBot2024/blob/main/src/main/java/competition/subsystems/lights/LightSubsystem.java
[15] No code on robot:
RoboRIO inactive/not receiving serial data from RoboRIO

[7] Disabled without auto
RoboRIO is disabled, and has NO autonomous program set

[6] Disabled with auto
RoboRIO is disabled, and DOES have autonomous program set


--< Modes for when RoboRIO is enabled >--
Priority: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5

[5] Enabled
RoboRIO is enabled, but none of the above are active.

[1] Signal:
For communication with teammates to activate amplifier

[2] Ready to shoot:
The robot shooter and arm is in position, ready to shoot note

[3] Has note:
The robot currently is holding a note

[4] Vision:
The robot spots a note (tells the driver that they can press a button for
robot to retrieve a note)
